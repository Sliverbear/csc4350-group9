To set up development environment:
*Following this tutorial: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/nodejs-devenv.html

1. Install Node.js from nodejs.org
2. Install npm from npmjs.com
3. Install aws-sdk in terminal
	"npm install aws-sdk"
4. Install express in terminal
	"npm install -g express"
5. Add express to your PATH variable if needed

To run the app locally
1. Install dependencies with npm
	"npm install"
2. Start server
	"npm start"

NOTE: Lock down dependency versions with "npm shrinkwrap" (Only do if deploying into production).
NOTE: "npm start" is also the command AWS Elasticbeanstalk runs to start the server.
